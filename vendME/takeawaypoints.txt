->two methods for react native
1.  without using expo
2.  using expo

-> while using expo you can encounter problem of app.js/app.tsx not seen inside root.     if app.js is not visible then delete the project
do not directly run that command 

1) run this instead :
npm install -g expo-cli
2) after that run :
expo init my-new-project
3) then go to the directory:
cd my-new-project
4) and run the project
